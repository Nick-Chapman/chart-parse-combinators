Ocaml parser combinators for CFG grammars. Supports left recursion and ambiguity.
Implemention based on chart parsing techniques (Earley / CYK) but with a functional programming twist!

Examples:
(1) Arithmetic expressions
(2) Catalan: very ambiguous grammar (any binary tree): the number of parses for an input of length N being the Nth Catalan number
